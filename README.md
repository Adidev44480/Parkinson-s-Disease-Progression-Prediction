# Parkinson's Disease
* Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement.
* It occurs due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to symptoms like tremors (involuntary, rhythmic shaking movements, most commonly affecting the hands and arms), stiffness, slow movement, and balance problems.
* While there is no cure, treatments like medication and therapy can help manage symptoms.
